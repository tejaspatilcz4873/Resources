
>> To adjust the width of a particular column/row, place the cursor at the junction of that column/row and the next one. Then use double-click.

>> To adjust the width of all columns/rows in a particular sheet, select the whole worksheet and place the cursor at the junction of first and second column/row. 
Then use double-click.

>> If you want to change the datatype for a particular column/row in a sheet, use the datatype option from the numbers ribbon. Also this ribbon allows you to use 
the different formats for the same datatype. E.g. you can use different forms of date or currency based on the country. It also allows you to adjust the decimals 
for numerical datatypes using increase decimal or decrease decimal options. It also provides an option to convert values into percentages.

>> Conditional formatting under the styles ribbon can be used to highlight certain cells in a column/row based on rules such as greater than, lesser than, equal to,
 presence of certain test/characters, presence of duplicates, top 10, top 10% , bottom 10, bottom 10%, above average, below average.

>> Conditional formatting can also be used for visualization purposes through the use of data bars, color scales and icon sets options.

>> The cells ribbon can be used to add/delete the rows/columns and also to format the cells.

>> Autosum option under the editing ribbon allows you to sum the values of an particular column/row. To use Autosum, select all the cells that you want to sum-up
plus one extra cell below where you want the summed-up value to appear and then click on Autosum.

>> Also we can get the most often used values of measuremnt(Avg, sum, count) by just selecting the required cells/columns/rows.

>> Fill option is present under editing ribbon and can be used to autofill values based on certain series.

>> Named-ranges is an option that makes usage of formulas on a selection of cells from a particular column/row more efficient. To create named-range, select the cells from
column/row you want to operate and then rename the range to some relevant name by going to name box located to the left of formula bar and pressing enter. Then while using 
formulas, instead of entering the cell location/number, use the named-range in the formula for the first cell where value needs to calculated and it would apply the same 
formula over whole of the range. 

>> Proper selection of range is necessary for named-ranges to function properly without any errors. In case of large datasets, use of keyboard shorcuts to navigate the cells 
in the spreadsheet thus becomes necessary. E.g. "use of ctrl + arrow keys" for navigation and "ctrl + shift + arrow keys" for selection. Post the selection the formula can be 
applied on whole range using "ctrl + d".

>> Named-ranges can be edited/created/deleted using the Name Manager option present under "Defined Names" ribbon in the formulas tab. This "Defined Names" ribbon also allows
you to create multiples named-range in a singel-go using 'Create from selection' option. You need to provide the proper selection of cells to the option and it would create 
relevant named-ranges for you.

>> If your dataset contains huge number of rows and you want to create a new calculated column using the formula and extend the formula for all the rows for that particular 
column, then use the column present just before the calculated column to navigate to the last row of the dataset and create the required selection using 'ctrl + shift + up key' 
and then press 'ctrl + d' for extending formula to all rows.

>> Creation of table from the dataset opens doors for many formatting and other useful features for generating insights for analytics. To create a table from an existing dataset 
in the sheet, we can use "Format as Table" option from styles ribbon under home tab. Also we can table option from insert tab for the same. Keyboard shortcut for the same 
is 'ctrl + t'.

>> Slicer is one of the most important options that would be accessible when a dataset is converted to a table. Slicer let you to filter the dataset based on values from a certain 
column and also looks visually appealing which creates a quite a good impression while someone's giving the presentation based on excel data.

>> Mutiple slicers can be added for more detailed filter on data.


*************************************************************************************************
Different excel shortcuts for navigation 

1. Go to last row of the datset : ctrl + down arrow key
2. Go to last column of the datset : ctrl + right arrow key

3. Go to first row of the datset : ctrl + up arrow key
4. Go to first column of the datset : ctrl + left arrow key

5. Go to first cell of the datset : ctrl + home
1. Go to last column of the datset : ctrl + end

Use of shift key along with navigation shortcuts can be used for selection of navigated cells.
*************************************************************************************************

>> You can also use the logical operators in conjunction with sum, avg and other mathematical function to generate complex/nested functions to get required insights in the excel.

>> "Text to columns" functionality present under data tools ribbon allows you to split a column based on delimiters/fixed width as part of data cleaning. Note that before we use this 
functionality we need to add an extra column after the column that needs to be split because it would otherwise overwrite the data in next column with the split data.
