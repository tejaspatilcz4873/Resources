
>> SQL stands for Structure Query Language.

>> It was developed by IBM in 1970s for managing, manipulating and extracting data from relational databases.

>> Relational Databases(RDBMS) are table-based(row and columns) databases and relationships can be formed between different tables using the primary and foreign keys.

>> Relational Databases are ACID-compliant.

>> ACID above stands for Automicity, Consistency, Isolation and Durablity.

>> Atomicity : There is nothing like partial transaction i.e. all or nothing. Either entire transaction is executed or no part of it is executed.

>> Consistency : Data is equally valid and no anamoly before/after transactions.

>> Isolation : Multiple transactions don't affect each other while running concurrently.

>> Duability : Committed data is never lost unless someone deletes SQL DML commands.

>> Examples of RDBMS : Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server, SQLite
