--------------------------------------------------------Networking Basics--------------------------------------------------------

>> Computers or similar computing devices connected with each other through the use of cables/wireless technologies form a computer network.

>> Computer networks help in communication and sharing of the resources.

>> Internet is the interconnected collection of computer networks following certain protocols. That's a kind of a supernetwork.

>> Protocol refers to certain set of rules that govern the exchange and transmission of information over the network.

>> World Wide Web(WWW) refers to a system of interconnected resources available over the Internet. Worldwide Web is built on top of Internet and it is a way to allow the sharing of information.

>> IP address is a uniquely assigned identifier or address for every device or computer that's connected over a computer network and it helps for identifying the presence of any device over the network and accordingly correctly share the required data.

>> There are two types of IP addresses. They are ipv4 and ipv6.

>> Ipv 4 address is a 32 bit address comprising of numbers. 
   E.g. 193.1.255.5 where nos. between the dots form a binary.
		
>> Any device connected over a network might have multiple processes running on it. So in order to distinguish between the processes, we need a port number. Each process is assigned a port number, and hence distinguishes the data based on the process. 

>> All these processes running on a computer are bound by the same IP address, but a different port number. 

>> The combination of IP address and port number is known as the socket number.

>> IP addresses identify the end systems or devices, whereas the port numbers identify the applications or processes on the end systems or devices. 

>> Every application or process on a computer has a unique 16 bit binary port number. It ranges from 0 to 65535.

>> Port numbers ranging from zero to 1023 are called as well-known ports, and reserved for specific applications and protocols. 

>> Port number 18 is reserved for http and port number 443 is reserved for https. So all the traffic coming from these two routes would be coming through the port numbers 80 and 443. 

>> Port numbers 1024 to 49152 are called as registered ports and they are used by specific applications but are not system reserved. 

>> The remaining ports in the range of 4915 to 65535 are called future ports and are not frequently used. 



--------------------------------------------------------Domain Name System(DNS)--------------------------------------------------------
 
>> DNS stands for domain name system. Domain names are unique names or identifiers that identifies a particular website and are mapped to an IP address. 

>> IP addresses are difficult for humans to interpret. Hence, DNS is the layer that helps to map domains to IP addresses.  

>> DNS lookup is the process in which domain to IP resolution is done. 

>> In microsoft windows based systems, any of the following commands can be used on command line for getting IP address from domain name :
	1. ping google.com (this command works on Linux as well)
	2. nslookup google.com
	
>> In microsoft windows based systems, following command can be used on command line for getting IP address of you system :
	1.type ipconfig and then press enter.
	
>> In Linux based systems, any of the following commands can be used on command line for getting IP address from domain name :
	1. ping google.com
	2. dig google.com
	3. dig google.com +short
	
>> Modern day DNS has a hierarchy and hence, the url of any website is divided into three independent parts namely top level domain, second level domain and sub-domain.
	E.g. cs.harvard.edu consists of 'cs' as sub-domain, 'harvard' as second level domain and 'edu' as top level domain.
	
	
>> Root DNS servers that exist at the top of the hierarchy point to multiple top level domain servers like '.com', '.gov', '.edu', '.in', etc. 

>> When you as a client make a request to a root server, it returns you in response, the address of top level domain server. 

>> Post getting the address of top level domain server, you make a request to this top level domain server. In response, the top level domains server then gives you address of the second level domain server.

>> You then make a request to this second level domain server to get the sub-domain server address.

>> Every organization has to maintain its DNS records. And for the same a self-owned or a 3rd party server is used. And that's called authoritative DNS server. 

>> There are mainly two networking models. These are TCP/IP and OSI model. 

>> TCP/IP stands for Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol. 

>> TCP/IP model consists of five layers. These are application layer, transport layer, network layer, data link layer and physical layer. 

>> Application layer is implemented on end softwares. Also, the end users interact with this particular network layer.  

>> Application layer is the one that starts an outgoing message journey in the network stack. 

>> The protocols like HTTP, FTP, SMTP exist in application layer. 

>> Transport layer is responsible for reliable data transfer. It also ensures that data packets are transferred in correct order. 

>> TCP and UDP protocols exist in transport layer. When data comes to transport layer, we call it as datagram if the protocol used is UDP and we call it as segment, if the protocol used is TCP.

>> TCP provides a reliable connection and its slower than UDP, due to use of acknowledgement mechanism. UDP can be unreliable, but faster. 

>> Use cases for TCP are chatting, email communication. Whereas for UDP, the use-cases are live streams, live podcasts and online gaming. 

>> The datagrams or segments received from transport layer into network layer are called as data packets. 

>> The network layer is responsible for transportation of data packets from one end system to another. They are also responsible for handling the routing of data packets through Internet Protocol present in the layer. 

>> Network layer is also responsible for multiplexing and demultiplexing of the data packets. 

>> Datalink layer handles flow control and error detection and correction if required. 

>> Datalink layer gets the data packets from network layer and transfers them to physical layer.

>> Physical layer consists of cables or wires or wireless transmission mediums that are used for physical communication and sending the data in the form of electric signals over long distances.

>> When the data in the form of electric signals reaches the end system (present at the other end), then reverse process occurs. That is, the data enters from physical layer into the data link layer. From there, it goes to network layer, then transport layer. and then application layer. 

>> In OSI model, the functions of application layer are subdivided by introduction of 2 more layers called presentation layer and session layer. 

>> The presentation layer is responsible for encoding and decoding of the data, whereas the session layer is responsible for maintaining the user sessions. 



--------------------------------------------------------Web Sockets--------------------------------------------------------

>> Web Sockets facilitate real-time communication and are used highly in chatting applications like whatsapp, livefeed applications.

>> Web Sockets are helpful to build applications that respond immediately to user actions, chat apps, live feed,etc.

>> Web Sockets are based on TCP protocol.

>> Three modes of data transmission are simplex, half-duplex and full-duplex(bi-directional).

>> Web Sockets are full-duplex where traditional http is a simplex system.



--------------------------------------------------------Internet Protocol : ipv4--------------------------------------------------------

>> Design was based on following assumptions :
	1. It should provide a unreliable connection service. 
	2. Must have fixed 32 bit binary address consisting of four octets.
	3. IP host should be able to exchange variable length data packets. 

>> Address assignment is based on sub-nets. Routers maintain the routes towards 'blocks of addresses' called sub-nets and not individual hosts.

>> Subnetting is a method of dividing a single physical network into logical sub-networks (subnets). Subnetting allows a business to expand its network without requiring a new network number from its Internet service provider. Subnetting helps to reduce the network traffic and also conceals network complexity. Subnetting is necessary when a single network number must be assigned to several portions of a local area network (LAN).

>> This sub-nets are assigned to ISPs(Internet Service Providers). The ISPs then assign the IP addresses within subnet in hierarchal manner.

>> A sub-net may consist of multiple LANs.

>> The 32 bit IP address has two parts. Those are sub-network ID and host ID. The higher order bits of 32 bit binary IP address refer to subnet ID and lower order bits referred to the host ID. 

>> When a router needs to send a data packet, it must know the subnet of the destination address and then routing table needs be consulted to forward the packets in the appropriate subnet to destination address. 

>> The IP addresses are defined and divided into 5 different classes named A, B, C, D, and E. 

>> Characteristics of class A :
	1. First bit of IP address is always '0' and hence, 2 raised to power 32 unique addresses are possible.
	2. In Class A, First 8 bit octet represents the network ID and the rest of the 3 octets represent the host ID. 
	3. At max there can be 2^7 different sub-network ids present in class A(first bit being '0' for subnet ID). 
	4. At Max, there can be (2^24 - 2) different hosts in Class A. This is due to the fact that in every network, the first and the last IP addresses are not assigned to any host. The first IP address is called the network address and the last IP address is called the broadcast address.
	5. Hence, X.0.0.0 and X.255.255.255 are reserved for network address and broadcast address in class A. 'X' here represents subnet ID and lies in the range (0-127) for class A.
	6. If we want to broadcast a request to all the hosts present in a particular subnet, then we use the broadcast address. We send a request to this broadcast address and the request gets broadcast to all hosts in the subnet. 
	7. Default mask for class A is 255.0.0.0
	

>> Characteristics of class B :
	1. The first two bits of 32 binary IP address are fixed to 10. 
	2. Since first two bits of 32 bit binary address are fixed, there can be at max, 2^30 different IP addresses in class B.
	3. In Class B, the first two octets represent the network id and the last two octets represent the host ID. 
	4. Due to above fact, there are 2^14 different network ids in class B.
	5. At max, there can be (2^16 - 2) different hosts in class B.
	6. Network address is X.Y.0.0 and broadcast address is X.Y.255.255. Here, 'X' would lie in range (128-191) and 'Y' lies in range (0-255).
	7. Default mask is 255.255.0.0

>> Characteristics of class C :
	1. The first three bits of 32 binary IP address are fixed to 110. 
	2. Since first three bits of 32 bit binary address are fixed, there can be at max, 2^29 different IP addresses in class C.
	3. In Class C, the first three octets represent the network id and the last one octet represent the host ID. 
	4. Due to above fact, there are 2^21 different network ids in class C.
	5. At max, there can be (2^8 - 2) different hosts in class C.
	6. Network address is X.Y.Z.0 and broadcast address is X.Y.Z.255. Here, 'X' would lie in range (192-223) and both 'Y','Z' lie in range (0-255).
	7. Default mask is 255.255.255.0
	
>> Characteristics of class D :
	1. The first four bits of 32 binary IP address are fixed to 1110 and hence the value of first octet would lie in range (224-239).
	2. Since first four bits of 32 bit binary address are fixed, there can be at max, 2^28 different IP addresses in class D.
	3. In Class D, there are not preserved network ids and host IDs since it is used for special purposes like multicasting. 
	4. No subnet mask for class D.
	
>> Characteristics of class E :
	1. The first four bits of 32 binary IP address are fixed to 1111 and hence the value of first octet would lie in range (240-255).
	2. Since first four bits of 32 bit binary address are fixed, there can be at max, 2^28 different IP addresses in class E.
	3. In Class D, there are not preserved network ids and host IDs since it is used for military purposes. 
	4. No subnet mask for class E.
